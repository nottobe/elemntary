## Installation

The easiest way to install it is to download a pre-built release zip-file for your Operating System:

## Usage

In order for your Wahoo computers to be controllable by Elemntary they need to be authorized. The authorization process
depends on the model. Follow the instructions:

1. turn the device on (make sure it's not connected via usb yet)
2. press keys on device
    - BOLT v1 and ROAM
        - press the power button (you enter the settings menu)
        - press the power button again (you return to the normal screen)
    - BOLT v2
        - press the power, up and down buttons at the same time (this is a bit hard, but give it several tries if it
          doesn't work)
3. connect the device to your pc
